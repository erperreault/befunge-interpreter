Interpreter for [Befunge-93](https://github.com/catseye/Befunge-93), implemented in Python.

From the reference repository, About Befunge-93:

Befunge-93 is an esoteric programming language where the program exists in a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell contains a single instruction, and execution can proceed in any cardinal direction across this grid -- not just left-to-right, but also right-to-left, top-to-bottom, and bottom-to-top.
