### Befunge-93 Interpreter

An interpreter for Befunge-93, implemented in Python.

> Befunge-93 is an esoteric programming language where the program exists in a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell contains a single instruction, and execution can proceed in any cardinal direction across this grid -- not just left-to-right, but also right-to-left, top-to-bottom, and bottom-to-top.

*From the [reference repository](https://github.com/catseye/Befunge-93).*

To run locally: 
* `git clone` this repository
* From the base directory run `python befunge_interpreter.py target_file.b93` to print the output of a given file.
